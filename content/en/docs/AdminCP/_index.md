    The AdminCP (Admin Control Panel), like the Site Builder is used to manage your site. While the Site Builder manages the outward facing appearance of your vBulletin site, the AdminCP controls the backend operations of your site. From usergroup permission settings to human verification options, the ability to modify and control these options can be found in the AdminCP.

    This is the page editing tool. This is the same as the "Edit Page" tools but will create a new page on your site along with a corresponding page template. Each page template consists of a layout and one or more modules.

In order to create a page, you need to turn on Site Builder. You do that by clicking [button="sb-editsite"]Edit Site[button] to the right of your username. This will reveal a menu along the top of your webpage. From here, you want to click on the “New Page” link. This opens the Page Editor with four tabs. These are: Add Module, Layouts, Template, and Color Style.

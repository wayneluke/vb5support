Welcome to the vBulletin 5 Connect manual! This guide shows you how to get started creating technical documentation sites using vBulletin, including site customization and how to use vBulletin's modules, channels and templates.

## What is vBulletin?

vBulletin is a Community Driven Content Management System. vBulletin Connect is a community platform with content that is contributed by your end users. The system allows you to build custom community sites without coding. Community driven content management allows for content that is always fresh and relevent. Using vBulletin allows you to engage your users in content creation, collation and distribution. vBulletin 5 has been designed to bring you modern community building and ease of use.

## Features

### Everything is Content

In vBulletin 5, we’ve developed an idea that everything is content. This is built around a new content model involving channels, nodes and the
actual content. In this model everything works the same, everything is searchable and everything provides a modern input system. Adding new
content should be more intuitive for your users.

### New Themes
vBulletin 5 is customizable through the use of Styles and Language Packs. Styles are made up of HTML and CSS which you can customize within the Administrator Control Panel. Language Packs allow you to translate the text of the user interface to any language.

---
### vBulletin Messenger

Live real-time private chat for your members. Chats can be one-on-one or with small groups of people. Each chat is held in its own interface to keep things separate and allow action on other parts of the site at the same.

---
### Responsive Design

People are using devices of many different sizes these days. These include phones, tablets and ultra-high density monitors. We’ve included a responsive design in vBulletin 5 that scales to the device being used. No more worrying about mobile styles and trying to configure things for multiple devices. vBulletin adjusts to the screen-size of the user’s device automatically.
